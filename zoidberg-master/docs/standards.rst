Standards
=========

Working with a bunch of instruments requires that different systems agree on
some things. This is meant to be a comprehensive list of standards used in
Zoidberg code.

Time stamps
-----------

A time stamp is simple a string that can be converted into a time. There are a
lot of ways to do this.

    from zoidberg.utils import timestamp
    print(timestamp())

An example timestamp is ``19_073_16_37_35_996``. This is read

* Year
* Julian day (day number out of 365/366)
* Hour (out of 24)
* Min
* Sec
* Milisec

File names
----------

There will be a number of files automatically generated by zoidberg over the
course of a mission. These files, for example camera stills, should be saved by
timestamp name. Since there are both color and depth stills, these are
designated with an additional string.

* Camera still:``img_19_073_16_37_35_996.jpeg``
* Depth still: ``depth_19_073_16_37_35_996.jpeg``

Standard output string for an object dection
---------------------------------------------
Vision will return this standard string for each object identified in an image.
The sting will look like

``img_19_067_11_50_05_560, 001, 463, 0432, 034, 056, 19_067_11_50_05_561``

* File name
* Object ID
* center_x
* center_y
* width
* height
* time stamp at the end of the image processing
